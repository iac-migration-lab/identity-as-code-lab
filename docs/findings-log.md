## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Phase 0 started
- What the docs said: Phase 0 installs Terraform CE (Community Edition) 1.11+, Azure CLI (command-line interface), SailPoint CLI, Conftest, PowerShell 7 + Microsoft365DSC (Desired State Configuration), and Node; exit requires `terraform -version`, `sail --version`, `conftest --version` recorded here.
- What actually happened: Tool versions detected on this machine (macOS 26.6.2, arm64, Homebrew 7.0.6) before any install:
  - terraform: not installed
  - az: not installed
  - sail: not installed
  - conftest: not installed
  - pwsh: 7.6.6 (Homebrew cask)
  - node: 26.8.1 (Homebrew; "Current" line, not LTS (Long-Term Support). Prism 5.16.0 needs Node >= 24.18.0; lab will use Node 24.21.0 LTS side by side, see docs/tool-install.md)
  - git: 2.55.0
  - Microsoft365DSC module: not installed
  - prism: not installed
- Time taken: under 1 hour (skeleton docs only).
- Evidence: shell output in the Phase 0 Claude Code session; docs/tool-install.md lists target versions verified 2026-10-01.
- Change to the client plan, if any: None yet. Observation: Microsoft365DSC docs now require PowerShell 7.6+ but do not mention macOS or Linux support; Phase 7 may need a Windows GitHub Actions runner.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Azure CLI and the PowerShell cask install through Homebrew, which only offers the current version; versions are pinned by assertion (check block) and `brew pin`, not by exact install.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Install block 1 run (stopped at PowerShell step)
- What the docs said: docs/tool-install.md install block downloads and checksum-verifies Terraform, SailPoint CLI, Conftest, and Node; installs Prism, Azure CLI, PowerShell 7 (as a Homebrew cask), and Microsoft365DSC; then writes `~/lab-tools/env.sh`.
- What actually happened:
  - Checksums OK: terraform_1.16.4_darwin_arm64.zip, sail_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz, conftest_0.71.0_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz, node-v24.21.0-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.
  - SailPoint CLI tarball holds the binary at `sail_Darwin_arm64/bin/sail`, not at the root; extract line changed to `--strip-components 2` before this run.
  - Prism 5.16.0 installed (210 packages). npm deprecation warnings for transitive deps uuid@8.3.2, json-schema-ref-parser@6.1.0, @faker-js/faker@5.5.3. npm skipped the `@scarf/scarf` postinstall script (install telemetry) because it is not allow-listed; left blocked on purpose.
  - Azure CLI 2.90.0 installed via Homebrew and pinned (`brew list --pinned` shows azure-cli). Side effect: Homebrew also installed libsodium 1.0.22 and upgraded readline 8.3.6 and xz 5.8.4.
  - Script stopped at `brew install --cask powershell`: "Cask 'powershell' is unavailable: No Cask with this name exists." PowerShell is now a Homebrew formula; `brew info powershell` shows formula 7.6.6 installed. The 2026-10-01 "Phase 0 started" entry calling it a cask was wrong.
  - Not done because the script stopped: Microsoft365DSC install, `~/lab-tools/env.sh`.
  - Spot check after the run: terraform v1.16.4, sail 2.6.0, conftest 0.71.0, node v24.21.0, az 2.90.0.
- Time taken: about 10 minutes.
- Evidence: terminal output pasted into the Claude Code session 2026-10-01; `~/lab-tools/bin` contains terraform, sail, conftest.
- Change to the client plan, if any: Install scripts must check Homebrew formula vs cask at run time; package type changes without notice.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Prism carries deprecated transitive npm packages (mock server only, local, no real data).

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Version check run before install finished
- What the docs said: docs/tool-install.md version check block sources `~/lab-tools/env.sh`, then prints each tool version for this log.
- What actually happened: The check ran before the two remaining install steps (Microsoft365DSC install, writing `~/lab-tools/env.sh`). Output:
  - `source`: no such file `~/lab-tools/env.sh`
  - terraform, sail, conftest, prism: "command not found" (binaries exist in `~/lab-tools/bin`, but that folder is not on PATH (the shell's search list) without env.sh)
  - az: 2.90.0
  - pwsh: PowerShell 7.6.6
  - Microsoft365DSC: "InvalidOperation: You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression." (module not installed)
  - node: v26.8.1 (Homebrew Node, not the lab's 24.21.0, because env.sh is missing)
  - git: 2.55.0
- Time taken: under 5 minutes.
- Evidence: terminal output pasted into the Claude Code session 2026-10-01; same result when Claude ran the check in its own shell.
- Change to the client plan, if any: The version check should test that env.sh exists first and print one clear "install incomplete" line, instead of a cascade of "command not found" errors.
- Accepted risks added, if any: None.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Lab tools moved into the project folder
- What the docs said: docs/tool-install.md put pinned binaries in `~/lab-tools/`.
- What actually happened: Owner asked for the tools to live inside the project. Moved `~/lab-tools` (587 MB: bin, dl, node) to `~/Projects/okta-to-entra-migration/lab-tools/` with `mv`; nothing re-downloaded. Prism's link is relative, so it survived the move. Added `lab-tools/` to .gitignore; `git status` confirms it is not tracked. Updated every path in docs/tool-install.md. Entries above that say `~/lab-tools` describe the old location.
- Time taken: under 5 minutes.
- Evidence: `ls lab-tools` shows bin, dl, node; `git status --short` shows no lab-tools files.
- Change to the client plan, if any: None.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Tool binaries sit inside the repo folder; protected from commit only by .gitignore.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Install finished, version check passed
- What the docs said: Phase 0 exit requires `terraform -version`, `sail --version`, `conftest --version` recorded here. docs/tool-install.md pins the versions below.
- What actually happened: Claude ran the two remaining steps locally (no cloud or provider API calls): wrote `lab-tools/env.sh`, and ran `Install-Module Microsoft365DSC -RequiredVersion 1.26.909.1 -Scope CurrentUser -Force` (15 seconds, no errors, no output). Version check after `source lab-tools/env.sh`:
  - terraform: Terraform v1.16.4
  - az: 2.90.0 (Homebrew, pinned)
  - sail: sail version 2.6.0
  - conftest: Conftest: 0.71.0
  - pwsh: PowerShell 7.6.6 (Homebrew formula)
  - Microsoft365DSC: 1.26.909.1
  - node: v24.21.0 (lab copy; `which node` resolves to lab-tools/node/bin)
  - prism: 5.16.0
  - git: 2.55.0
  All match the pinned versions in docs/tool-install.md. The three Phase 0 exit versions (terraform, sail, conftest) are recorded.
- Time taken: under 5 minutes.
- Evidence: version check output in the Claude Code session 2026-10-01; `brew list --pinned` shows azure-cli.
- Change to the client plan, if any: None. Microsoft365DSC installs on macOS; whether `Export-M365DSCConfiguration` runs on macOS is still UNVERIFIED until Phase 7.
- Accepted risks added, if any: None.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Private GitHub repo created; environment gates not available on it
- What the docs said: CLAUDE.md says applies run only through GitHub Actions with environment gates, and secrets live in GitHub environment secrets. Before checking, Claude said (UNVERIFIED) that free-plan private repos lack required reviewers but GitHub Pro would fix it.
- What actually happened:
  - Owner approved; Claude ran `gh repo create mlencioni/okta-to-entra-migration --private --source . --remote origin --push`. Repo: https://github.com/mlencioni/okta-to-entra-migration, visibility PRIVATE, personal account (not a company org). Pushed `main` (commits 3c682fa, 61b87d6).
  - GitHub docs (deployments-and-environments reference, read 2026-10-01) say, for Free, Pro, and Team plans on private repos: required reviewers, wait timers, custom protection rules, and admin bypass are public-repo only. Free private repos also get no environment secrets, no environment variables, and no deployment branch restrictions; Pro or Team adds those three, but not reviewers. Claude's earlier "Pro fixes it" was wrong: reviewers on a private repo need GitHub Enterprise.
  - Account plan not confirmed (`gh api user --jq .plan.name` returned nothing with the current token scopes); assumed Free.
- Time taken: under 10 minutes.
- Evidence: `gh repo view --json visibility,url`; https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/deployments-and-environments
- Change to the client plan, if any: Decide before Phase 1 workflows: (a) make the lab repo public (nothing secret is committed; federated credentials need no stored secret), or (b) stay private and replace environment gates with branch protection plus a manual `workflow_dispatch` apply, with secrets at repo level. Client plan should state that environment-gated applies on private repos need GitHub Enterprise.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Until decided, the repo has no enforceable apply gate; no apply workflow exists yet, so no live exposure.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Repo moved to lab org per docs/lab-naming.md
- What the docs said: docs/lab-naming.md and the plan put the repo at `iac-migration-lab/identity-as-code-lab`, public, in a free lab org, not under the owner's personal account.
- What actually happened:
  - Claude had created `mlencioni/okta-to-entra-migration` without reading docs/lab-naming.md (process miss; caught during the pre-public scan, before anything was public).
  - Pre-public scan of all tracked files and full history: no secrets, keys, or client names. Only personal data: owner's name and personal email as commit author on all commits.
  - Owner created org `iac-migration-lab` (Free plan) in the browser; owner is admin.
  - Claude transferred and renamed the repo with `gh api -X POST repos/mlencioni/okta-to-entra-migration/transfer -f new_owner=iac-migration-lab -f new_name=identity-as-code-lab`, and set `origin` to https://github.com/iac-migration-lab/identity-as-code-lab.git. Still PRIVATE.
  - Local folder name stays `okta-to-entra-migration`; only the GitHub name changed.
- Time taken: about 15 minutes.
- Evidence: `gh api repos/iac-migration-lab/identity-as-code-lab --jq '.full_name + " " + .visibility'` returned `iac-migration-lab/identity-as-code-lab private`.
- Change to the client plan, if any: Read the naming doc before creating any named resource.
- Accepted risks added, if any: None yet; author email decision pending before the repo goes public.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Commit email rewritten, repo recreated, made public
- What the docs said: Plan and docs/lab-naming.md: repo is public (needed for free environment gates and environment secrets). No personal data in the repo.
- What actually happened:
  - Rewrote author and committer email on all commits to `mark@lencioni.io` with `git filter-branch --env-filter` (first to the GitHub noreply address, then to mark@lencioni.io at the owner's request). Dates and file contents unchanged (`git diff` against the pre-rewrite branch was empty). Repo-local `user.email` set to mark@lencioni.io. Force-pushed with `--force-with-lease`.
  - Finding: after the force-push, GitHub still served the old commits by SHA (the original commits returned the old personal email). A force-push does not remove commits from GitHub. Commit SHAs quoted in earlier entries (3c682fa, 61b87d6) were among them.
  - Fix: confirmed the repo held only `main` (0 forks, issues, releases, webhooks), owner added the `delete_repo` scope to the `gh` login, Claude ran `gh repo delete` then `gh repo create iac-migration-lab/identity-as-code-lab --private` and pushed `main`. All six old SHAs now return "No commit found". New history: ba98562, 2fb6215, d05e508, 53ef7ff, plus this entry.
  - Then set visibility to public.
  - Old SHAs in earlier entries of this log are now dead references; this entry maps them.
- Time taken: about 30 minutes, including a failed first `gh auth refresh`.
- Evidence: `gh api repos/iac-migration-lab/identity-as-code-lab/commits/<old sha>` returns 404 for 3c682fa, 61b87d6, 88d2358, d6eca41, 4ec1f3e.
- Change to the client plan, if any: To scrub data from a GitHub repo's history, rewriting plus force-pushing is not enough; delete and recreate the repo (or ask GitHub Support to purge) and check old SHAs before making it public. Set the commit email before the first commit.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Owner's name and mark@lencioni.io are public in commit metadata (accepted by owner).

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Lab email; company domain ruled out for Microsoft sign-ups
- What the docs said: Plan section 3: dedicated lab mailbox, "use a domain you control or a free Outlook address". CLAUDE.md: never reference or configure the owner's company Microsoft 365 tenant.
- What actually happened:
  - Owner proposed `okta-entra-mig@lencioni.io`. `dig MX lencioni.io` returned `lencioni-io.mail.protection.outlook.com`; owner confirmed lencioni.io is the company Microsoft 365 tenant.
  - Ruled out: creating the alias would configure the company tenant, and Microsoft would treat an `@lencioni.io` address on the Azure or Entra sign-up as an account in that tenant, so the lab subscription or admin roles could end up attached to it.
  - Owner created `la-migration-lab@outlook.com` (personal Microsoft account) for all lab sign-ups. Recorded in docs/lab-naming.md.
  - Okta sign-up page (https://developer.okta.com/signup/, read 2026-10-01) asks for "Work Email" and states no rule on free providers; whether it accepts outlook.com is still UNVERIFIED.
- Time taken: under 15 minutes.
- Evidence: MX lookup output in the Claude Code session 2026-10-01.
- Change to the client plan, if any: "A domain you control" is not enough: check that the domain is not a verified domain in any production Entra tenant before using it for Microsoft sign-ups. Check MX and ask the owner.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Lab email address is in the public repo (spam and phishing target); it protects only throwaway lab accounts. Use MFA on it.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Okta org created with the owner's work email
- What the docs said: Plan section 3: Okta needs a unique business email per org, so use a domain you control or a free Outlook address. Lab email is `la-migration-lab@outlook.com`.
- What actually happened:
  - Okta Integrator Free Plan sign-up rejected `la-migration-lab@outlook.com` (exact error text not captured). The plan's "free Outlook address" option does not work.
  - Owner signed up with `mark@lencioni.io` instead. Org: `integrator-2631921`; Admin Console https://integrator-2631921-admin.okta.com/; org URL https://integrator-2631921.okta.com.
  - Hard-rule check: no change was made to the company Microsoft 365 tenant. The address already existed; only Okta's sign-up and activation emails go to that mailbox. Not a breach of CLAUDE.md, but the Okta super admin now uses the owner's work identity.
- Time taken: under 15 minutes.
- Evidence: Org URL supplied by the owner 2026-10-01.
- Change to the client plan, if any: Free email providers fail Okta's "Work Email" check; lab staff need an address on a domain that is not tied to any production tenant. Budget a cheap throwaway domain if a clean separation is required.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Okta lab super admin uses `mark@lencioni.io`. Never connect this Okta org to the lencioni.io tenant (no Microsoft IdP, no Org2Org, no SCIM toward lencioni.io). That address can no longer sign up for another Integrator org (unique email per org). Enroll MFA on the Okta admin.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Azure account created; no spending limit
- What the docs said: Plan section 2: Azure free account, $200 credit for 30 days, credit card required, Terraform state storage costs pennies.
- What actually happened:
  - Owner signed up as `la-migration-lab@outlook.com` in a private browser window. `az login` shows one subscription, `Azure subscription 1` (6ea51c80-90de-4914-bbc6-2af9b54bba9f), in tenant `Default Directory` (bed5d4c3-98f0-4c73-9e4c-0b6cd3b9a0a4).
  - Read-only Graph check: the tenant's only verified domain is `lamigrationlaboutlook.onmicrosoft.com`. No link to lencioni.io.
  - Read-only Azure Resource Manager check: offer `PayAsYouGo_2014-09-01`, spending limit `Off`. Usage past the credit bills the card with no automatic stop. The plan assumed a capped free-trial offer.
  - Microsoft Learn "Access and create new tenant" (updated 2026-08-21) says only paid customers can create a new workforce tenant and that free-tenant or trial-subscription customers cannot. A Pay-As-You-Go offer suggests creating the lab tenant is allowed; UNVERIFIED until tried.
- Time taken: about 20 minutes.
- Evidence: `az account show`, `az rest` GET on /organization and on the subscription, Claude Code session 2026-10-01.
- Change to the client plan, if any: Before any spend, check the subscription offer and spending limit; set a budget alert on day one.
- Accepted risks added, if any: No spending cap on the lab subscription until a budget alert exists.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Lab Entra tenant is the Azure Default Directory
- What the docs said: Plan Phase 0: create a new Entra tenant. docs/lab-naming.md: `iacmigrationlab.onmicrosoft.com`. Microsoft Learn "Access and create new tenant" (updated 2026-08-21): only paid customers can create a new workforce tenant; if **Microsoft Entra ID** is unavailable on the Basics tab, review the paid-customer requirement.
- What actually happened:
  - First attempt reported success, but only `Default Directory` existed (checked with a read-only ARM `/tenants` call and in the portal's Directories + subscriptions).
  - Read-only check of the subscription, resource groups, resources, and 24-hour activity log: nothing extra created.
  - On retry, **Manage tenants** > **Create** offered only **Governed Workforce** and **External**; plain **Microsoft Entra ID** was missing, even though the subscription offer is Pay-As-You-Go.
  - Governed Workforce rejected: it creates a resource group and billing asset and a permanent governance link to the home tenant, none of which the plan covers. External is for customer identity (CIAM), wrong type.
  - Owner chose to use the Default Directory (`lamigrationlaboutlook.onmicrosoft.com`, tenant ID bed5d4c3-98f0-4c73-9e4c-0b6cd3b9a0a4) as the lab tenant. docs/lab-naming.md updated: initial domain, break-glass UPN `bg-admin-01@lamigrationlaboutlook.onmicrosoft.com`. Display name to be renamed to `IaC Migration Lab` by the owner.
- Time taken: about 30 minutes.
- Evidence: `az rest` GET https://management.azure.com/tenants, `az account list --all`, `az group list`, `az resource list`, `az monitor activity-log list --offset 1d`, Claude Code session 2026-10-01; owner's portal observations.
- Change to the client plan, if any: A new Azure Pay-As-You-Go account cannot create an extra plain workforce tenant (UNVERIFIED whether this changes after the first paid invoice). Labs should plan on the sign-up Default Directory as the test tenant.
- Accepted risks added, if any: The Azure subscription that will hold Terraform state lives in the same tenant as the lab's Conditional Access policies; a bad CA policy can lock the owner out of the state storage too. Break-glass exclusion (module + Conftest rule) covers this; the owner account `la-migration-lab@outlook.com` is a personal Microsoft account and should also be excluded from CA policies in the lab.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Budget alert on the lab subscription
- What the docs said: Previous entry: no spending cap until a budget alert exists.
- What actually happened: Owner approved. Claude created `budget-iac-lab-monthly` on subscription 6ea51c80-90de-4914-bbc6-2af9b54bba9f with `az rest --method put` to `Microsoft.Consumption/budgets` (api-version 2023-05-01): Cost category, $10 monthly, 2026-10-01 to 2027-09-30, actual-cost email alerts at 50/80/100% to `la-migration-lab@outlook.com`. Created by hand, not by Terraform; import it when the Azure state stack exists, or recreate it in code.
- Time taken: under 5 minutes.
- Evidence: PUT response returned name, amount 10.0, Monthly, three notifications.
- Change to the client plan, if any: None.
- Accepted risks added, if any: The budget alerts but cannot stop spend; the "no spending cap" risk is reduced, not closed.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, ServiceNow PDI unavailable; change gate made ITSM-agnostic
- What the docs said: Plan: ServiceNow Personal Developer Instance (PDI) for the Phase 3 change gate (`table/change_request` API).
- What actually happened: ServiceNow developer sign-up said no instances were available to join the waiting list. Owner chose to skip ServiceNow and design the change gate for any ITSM (IT Service Management) tool. New design in docs/change-gate-design.md: PR body names `Change: <system>:<id>`, one read-only adapter per ITSM returns a normalized record (state, window), and one shared check enforces it. Lab adapter uses GitHub Issues (labels for state, body lines for the window, `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `issues: read`). Plan and workflow placeholder updated to match.
- Time taken: under 15 minutes.
- Evidence: owner report of the ServiceNow sign-up message, 2026-10-01 (exact text not captured).
- Change to the client plan, if any: Change gate becomes ITSM-agnostic; the client's tool plugs in as an adapter. The ServiceNow-specific REST call and state mapping are now unvalidated in the lab and must be confirmed against the client's instance.
- Accepted risks added, if any: GitHub Issues as change records give no segregation of duties (any writer can relabel); the lab proves pipeline mechanics only.

## 2026-10-01, Phase 0, Exit check passed; Phase 0 closed
- What the docs said: Phase 0 exit: every account reachable; `terraform -version`, `sail --version`, `conftest --version` recorded in this log.
- What actually happened (all checks read-only):
  - GitHub: `iac-migration-lab/identity-as-code-lab`, PUBLIC, default branch `main`, local in sync with origin.
  - Azure: signed in as `la-migration-lab@outlook.com`; `Azure subscription 1` (6ea51c80-90de-4914-bbc6-2af9b54bba9f) Enabled; budget `budget-iac-lab-monthly` $10, current spend $0.00.
  - Entra: tenant bed5d4c3-98f0-4c73-9e4c-0b6cd3b9a0a4, display name `IaC Migration Lab` (owner renamed it), domain `lamigrationlaboutlook.onmicrosoft.com`. P2 trial not activated.
  - Okta: `https://integrator-2631921.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` returned HTTP 200 with issuer `https://integrator-2631921.okta.com`; owner has signed in to the Admin Console. Okta management API not tested yet (no service app until Phase 1).
  - ITSM: none; GitHub Issues stand-in needs no account (see docs/change-gate-design.md).
  - Tools: Terraform v1.16.4, sail version 2.6.0, Conftest 0.71.0 (full list in the "Install finished" entry).
  - Repo layout matches the plan.
- Time taken: Phase 0 total about 4 hours in one evening (plan said one evening).
- Evidence: `gh repo view`, `az account show`, Graph GET /organization, Consumption budget GET, curl to the Okta OpenID Connect discovery URL, tool version commands; Claude Code session 2026-10-01.
- Change to the client plan, if any: Phase 0 changes are in the entries above: Okta rejects free email providers; a new Azure account cannot create a second workforce tenant; Azure free account is Pay-As-You-Go with no spending limit; ServiceNow PDI unavailable; GitHub repo must be public for free environment gates and environment secrets.
- Accepted risks added, if any: None new.

Current phase set to 1 at the top of this log.

## 2026-10-07, Run 1, Lab Phase 1, Lab reframed as Implementation Phase 0; permissions opened up
- What the docs said: CLAUDE.md required a least-privilege block and owner approval before every grant, cloud change, or write API call; no SSWS tokens; no local `terraform apply`.
- What actually happened: Owner named this lab "Claude Identity as Code Implementation Phase 0" (IP0): personal free accounts and dummy data, to learn the CI/CD pipelines and migration code. Owner will run IP0 at least three times; run 1 goal is to see it all work. Owner pre-approved any permission and any lab resource change. CLAUDE.md rewritten: the least-privilege gate is replaced by docs/permission-register.md (every grant logged with a production verdict); local apply allowed for bootstrap and to get unstuck; isolation from `lencioni.io` and no-secrets-in-repo stay absolute. Plan phases are now "lab phases". Added docs/migration-runbook.md (skeleton). Added docs/okta-seed-spec.md and okta-inventory/seed/seed-okta-org.sh (not run yet). SAML test SP chosen: `sptest.iamshowcase.com` (samltest.id is down).
- Time taken: about 30 minutes.
- Evidence: this commit.
- Change to the client plan, if any: Production permissions come from the register's "Production should use" column, not from the lab.
- Accepted risks added, if any: Lab identities may hold broader grants than production would allow; each is listed in the register.
